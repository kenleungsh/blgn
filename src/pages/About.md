This blog deals with Web and mobile developments. It reflects my thoughts and my experimentations through many topics like WebSocket, Web Audio API, WebGL, WebRTC, Node.js... All scripts, code snippets are personal work, obviously **Open Source** and **free to use**. Feel free to contact or just say [hello@srchea.com](mailto:hello@srchea.com "Say hello!")!

### Bio of an Enthusiast Achiever

Currently working as a Software Engineer at Ubisoft (Owlient studio), I love thinking and developing Web and mobile applications. Also as a full-stack, I mainly work with Node.js, PHP for server-side and HTML5, JavaScript for client-side.

I take care of performance and user experience, I am also interested in troubleshooting high-volume, critical production environment and working with large data sets. To know more, here is [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/srchea "Sann-Remy Chea's LinkedIn profile").

Technical book reviews
----------------------
I reviewed the book: [Getting Started with HTML5 WebSocket Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-HTML5-WebSocket-Programming/dp/1782166963 "Getting Started with HTML5 WebSocket Programming on Amazon"). It explains how to use WebSocket and how it works for people who want to start learning.
